other build tools and an introduction on how it interacts with the DOM.
### Controllers
Where controllers fit into the Angular ecosystem and some best practices.
### Services
Reducing the complexity of Angular controllers and talking about "factories".

## React
### 1-way Databindings
How it differs from the Angular 2-way datbindings.
### JSX
What it is and what it do.
### Web Components
JSX based web components using React.
### Architecture
Creating full client side apps using React. Not sure if this will cover Backbone

### Testing
Effective testing using jasmine and the React mocking plugins.
## Auth/Auth
### Hooking up Angular/React to server side auth/auth
Creating service for Angular that takes care of auth/auth and a series of sign
