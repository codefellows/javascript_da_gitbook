# Testing
Testing is one of those programming practices that separates a 
hobyist from a professional. It's one of the more important pieces
of writing code which is why you're learning it first.

For testing on the server side we will be using a combination of
the libraries Mocha and Chai. Mocha contains the testing harness
that will describe what we're testing and take care of the setup 
ande tear down of our tests.

Chai is what gives the actual comparison statements that we will 
be using.
