By the end of this course you'll be able to build reactive Full Stack
Javascrip Web Applications. Essentially there will be two halves of
these applications, the server side and the client side. The two
will operate essentially independently and will pass data back and forth
between each other in the form of JSON. In the first half of the course
we concentrate on the server side. 

The server side will be the "data presistence" portion of our application. It will 
take incoming data from the client side app and store it in a database. This
database could be a variety of technologies but we'll focus primarily on
MongoDB.

The server will also send data back to the client side application when requested
that the client side can then display to a user of the application.

This architecture allows a lot of flexibility. Primarily the client side doesn't
have to be a web application. It can be a native app, a mobile app, another server,
anything. In fact at the end of the "server side" portion of the course you will
be teaming up with the iOS class to build the backend of an iOS app.

In the end our architecture will look something like this:
