# Assignment
For this assignment you will be building a basic server side REST framework. 
It should essentially be a series of functions that help you build a server
side REST framework. This assignment is intentionally open ended but here are some
concerns to keep in mind:
  * Your framework should favor asynchronous over syncronous code
  * It should probably use callbacks or some other form of async management
  * It should make it easier to process the different REST actions for various routes
    * GET
    * POST
    * PUT
    * PATCH
    * DELETE 
Your framework should have testing and the number one thing to remember is don't
over think it. Keep your framework simple and concise. If you're feeling ambitious
place it on npm.
