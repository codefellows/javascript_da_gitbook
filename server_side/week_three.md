# Assignment
This assignment is essentially a precursor to your 4th week project. Create a single
resource JSON REST API with a presistence layer and authentication. If you're feeling
ambitious create a web interface for this application using html and jQuery. Once
again this should include testing, a Gruntfile and package.json file. This should also
be deployed using Heroku or AWS and have travis.ci integration.
